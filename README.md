# DBLP-Data-Analysis
This repository focuses on loading the DBLP computer science bibliography dataset into MongoDB using Python. 
Efficient loading techniques are employed to minimize system resource usage. 
After loading the data, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed using MongoDB queries to extract relevant information. 
This includes visualizations such as bar charts and pie charts to provide insights into publications per year and the distribution of bibliography based on element types.
